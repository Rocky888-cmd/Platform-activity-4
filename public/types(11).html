        <p>
            Analytics involves taking a systematic and computational approach to analyzing data or statistics. The aim
            of analytics is to create meaningful, easily interpretable, and communicable patterns around the given data.
        </p>
        <p>
            An analytics platform refers to any service or tool that allows users to capture, process, analyze, and
            visualize data for better decision-making. Organizations and different departments (strategic business
            units) use analytics platforms to make data-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In areas such as computer programming and operations research, analytics is essential in quantifying
            performance. Organizations apply analytics to their business data to help them understand their data and
            make accurate predictions for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analytics platforms allow companies to employ their platforms on-premises or in the cloud. Industries such
            as marketing, finance, management, information security, online systems, and software services are the most
            significant users of analytics platforms
