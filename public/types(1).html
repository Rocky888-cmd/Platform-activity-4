          <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              An operating system is a technology platform that provides the essential functions needed to use hardware.
              This system software manages the application software and software programs on a computer or mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
              Operating systems are the lowest level of technology platforms. Every software runs on an operating system except embedded systems and low-level firmware.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are different types of operating systems based on their specific purposes. For example, a time-sharing operating system assists in scheduling tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              An operating system serves as an efficient intermediary between the computer hardware and programs for hardware functions, including input, output, and memory allocation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your mobile phones, video game consoles, personal computers, and supercomputers use an operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The operating system can either come pre-installed on a system or run directly from media such as a CD or flash memory.
            </p>
